Here's a little quiz game with functions, structs, and a main program (currently consisting of 4 questions).

## What is in this program?

There is a QuizGame.h file with many different functions in it, completely containing a quiz game format in it. In additon there is a maingame.cpp file that contains an example of how to use the functions to make a quiz game.
Overall, it's decently simple to use, albeit it could probably be slightly more optimized, but this is the best it will get for now.
