# Quiz Game - ThatMatthewFellow

Here's a little quiz game with functions, structs, and a main program (currently consisting of 3 questions). I will provide more detailed information as I develop this further.

## You may ask, why not just make a class for this?

It's because I'm learning about structs at the moment, and think they are cool, and I'm very familiar with procedural programming, so it's just easy this way for the time being. Later on, I'll also make a class version of this quiz game.
